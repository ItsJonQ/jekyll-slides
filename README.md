# Mr. Jekyll
A starter template for Jekyll

### Getting started

Once you have this repo cloned, run the following command:
```
bundle install
```

That's it! You should be ready to start developing your Jekyll blog.

### Wercker deploy
[http://wercker.com/](http://wercker.com/)

Rename the ``wercker-sample.yml`` to ``wercker.yml``, and adjust the variables as needed.
The default sample wercker.yml is configured for an SSH deploy, based on the Ruby docker (no Node support).
